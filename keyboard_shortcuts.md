# Keyboard Shortcuts

Developers prefer keyboard shortcuts to using the mouse; using the
mouse can slow you down significantly. Try to use the keyboard as much
as possible. Here's some good shortcuts to try:

## Atom

### Navigation

* Go to file: `Cmd + t`
* Close tab: `Cmd + w`
* Next tab: `Opt + Cmd + LArrow`
* Previous tab: `Opt + Cmd + RArrow`
* Go to line: `Ctl + G`
* Show project drawer: `Cmd + \`
  * Note: A project is a folder which contains multiple related files.
    These shortcuts will be very useful when we get to Rails.
* New tab: `Cmd + n`

### Finding

* Find: `Cmd + f`
* Find anywhere in project: `Shift + Cmd + f`

### Editing

* Comment out selection: `Cmd + /`
* Indent selection: `Cmd + ]`
* Unindent selection: `Cmd + [`
* Delete current line: `Shift + Ctl + k`
* Undo: `Cmd + z`

## Bash

When you open your terminal, bash is the program that reads your
commands to execute other programs. Fluency with bash is important.

Here are some core line-editing keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut        | Effect                      |
| ---------------:|:--------------------------- |
|    **ctrl + a** | cursor to beginning of line |
|    **ctrl + e** | cursor to end of line       |
|  **alt + left** | move to prev word           |
| **alt + right** | move to next word           |
|    **ctrl + w** | cut previous word           |
|    **ctrl + k** | cut to end of line          |
|    **ctrl + u** | cut to beginning of line    |
|    **ctrl + y** | paste terminal buffer       |

note: `alt + left` and `alt + right` don't work in iTerm by default.
